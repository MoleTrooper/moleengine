// user-facing version of the above macro for users to add their own types to the graph

/// Create a [`Graph`][super::Graph] with layers for the given custom types.
/// All Starframe types that are meant to be used as components will also receive layers.
///
/// DO NOT invoke this more than once. You will get either confusing compile errors
/// or broken graphs at runtime depending on arguments.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// # use starframe::graph::make_graph;
/// struct PlayerController;
/// struct Enemy;
/// struct ReallyCoolGameMechanic;
///
/// let graph = make_graph! {
///     PlayerController,
///     Enemy,
///     ReallyCoolGameMechanic,
/// };
/// ```
/// # Limitations
///
/// This macro implements the [`Component`][super::Component] trait on
/// your types to give them addresses in the graph at compile time.
/// Therefore, the orphan rule prevents you from adding types from other crates
/// to the graph directly. Instead, you need to define your own types containing
/// those foreign types.
///
/// This is also the reason why you can't invoke this macro more than once
/// â€” the graph structure is defined at compile time and multiple invocations would break it.
/// It is, however, possible (though not advised) to have multiple graphs with the same structure
/// like this:
/// ```
/// # use starframe::graph::{make_graph, Graph};
/// fn graph() -> Graph {
///     make_graph! {
///         // ...
///     }
/// }
/// let graph = graph();
/// ```
