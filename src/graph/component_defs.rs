// user-facing version of the above macro for users to add their own types to the graph

/// Create a [`Graph`][super::Graph] type with layers for the given custom types
/// and the correct size parameter set.
/// All Starframe types that are meant to be used as components will also receive layers.
///
/// DO NOT invoke this more than once. You will get either confusing compile errors
/// or broken graphs at runtime depending on arguments.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// # use starframe::graph::make_graph;
/// struct PlayerController;
/// struct Enemy;
/// struct ReallyCoolGameMechanic;
///
/// type MyGraph = make_graph! {
///     PlayerController,
///     Enemy,
///     ReallyCoolGameMechanic, // trailing commas are required!
/// };
/// let graph = MyGraph::new();
/// ```
/// # Limitations
///
/// This macro implements the [`Component`][super::Component] trait on
/// your types to give them addresses in the graph at compile time.
/// Therefore, the orphan rule prevents you from adding types from other crates
/// to the graph directly. Instead, you need to define your own types containing
/// those foreign types.
///
/// This is also the reason why you can't invoke this macro more than once
/// â€” the graph structure is defined at compile time and multiple invocations would break it.
/// ```
